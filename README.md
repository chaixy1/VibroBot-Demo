# VibroBot Demo

## Overview
The VibroBot Gesture Guidance System is an innovative real-time gesture guidance system designed to assist users, particularly those with limited vision, in performing precise hand gestures for virtual scenarios. By utilizing five VibroBots worn on each finger, the system provides haptic feedback to guide users through the process of learning and perfecting grab actions.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Gesture Recognition**: Captures and processes hand gestures at 30 frames per second.
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Interconnects components via a wireless local area network.
- **MediaPipe Integration**: Leverages Googleâ€™s open-source hand recognition for accurate joint positioning.
- **Haptic Feedback**: VibroBots provide real-time guidance through vibration modes.
- **Color-coded Error Representation**: Visual feedback indicates areas needing improvement.

## System Components
- **Camera**: Captures the user's hand gestures.
- **Virtual Scene**: Displays real-time gesture data and error analysis.
- **VibroBots**: Wearable devices that vibrate to guide finger positioning.
- **MediaPipe Algorithm**: Calculates hand joint positions from captured images.

## Installation
To install and set up the VibroBot Gesture Guidance System, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**
2. **Install Dependencies**
- List all the dependencies required for the project.
3. **Configure the System**
- Provide instructions to configure the camera, network, and other components.

## Usage
- **Start the System**: Run the main application to begin gesture capture and recognition.
- **Wear VibroBots**: Equip the VibroBots on each finger as instructed.
- **Perform Gestures**: Follow the virtual scene's feedback to adjust and perfect your gestures.

## Experiments and Results
Our experiments have shown that the VibroBot system significantly enhances the ability of participants with limited vision to perform standard grab actions. The system provides continuous haptic guidance until the successful grab is achieved, as defined by the criteria of 80% or more joint angles within an acceptable error range.
